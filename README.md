### By Graham Falk

Plays through a bunch of pictures at varying times. Starts time change every second but pressing number keys changes the speed ('1' makes it change every 0.1 seconds, '2' changes every 0.2 seconds, etc). Pressing '-' or '=' will decrement or increment the speed by 10%. 

Pressing 'p' plays a song that fits with the theme.
Clicking on Gordon Ramsey gives a funny voice clip.

DEBUG
Pressing space stops the timer and pressing 'a' or 'd' will change the pictures manually
